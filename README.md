Experiments
===========

This Visual Studio solution is my place to store experimental code. I create this code mainly when I am curious to try and play with some ideas. 

Whereas some of this solutions content may be proof of concept implementations, other parts may not be state of the art or even finished.

 
####SelfmadeIoC
A little project where I played around with creating my own IoC-Container. It is just an example implementation and for educational purposes. I suggest you do not use it in production. There are many better IoC-Containers out there and freely available too. (Ninject, Unity, Castle Windsor, Autofac, StructureMap, et. al. ... just to name a few)


####EFDecoupled
Its a project where I am playing around with Entity Framework, the Repository and the Unit of Work patterns... while just for fun trying to keep all of it decoupled using my SelfmadeIoC Container.
